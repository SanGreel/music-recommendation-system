# Content-based music recommendation system
In this repository is a music recommendation system based on track embeddings (representation).

We developed 2 approaches for embedding and search for similar audio compositions:
- Frequency decomposition
- Timbre and rhythm decomposition

Timbre and rhythm decomposition based approach shows impressive results. We think this algorithm can be used for real music recommend the system, at least as POC for this task.

If you are interested in some introduction to the music domain, we recommend You to run [audio_track_exploration.ipynb](https://github.com/SanGreel/music-recommendation-system/blob/master/audio_track_exploration.ipynb). In this file we describe some audio track characteristics and a few ways to decompose the audio track.

### How to reproduce
